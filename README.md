>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, 
who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age - and then have fallen away -
to be restored to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to open shame.

>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
a time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
a time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up;
a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
a time to seek, and a time to lose;
a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
a time to tear, and a time to sew;
a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
a time to love, and a time to hate;
a time for war, and a time for peace.

>Should a hater of justice be in control?
If you wouldn't tell a king, "You're a scoundrel!"
or nobles, "You are wicked men!"
then you shouldn't condemn the Just and Mighty One
who is neither partial towards princes
nor favors the rich over the poor
