>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, 
who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age - and then have fallen away -
to be restored to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to open shame.

>The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. 
For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.

>Remember your leaders who taught you the word of God. Think of all the good that has come from their lives, and follow the example of their faith.

>By faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God's command, that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen.

>For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
a time to be born, and a time to die;
a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
a time to kill, and a time to heal;
a time to break down, and a time to build up;
a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
a time to seek, and a time to lose;
a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
a time to tear, and a time to sew;
a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
a time to love, and a time to hate;
a time for war, and a time for peace.

>Should a hater of justice be in control?
If you wouldn't tell a king, "You're a scoundrel!"
or nobles, "You are wicked men!"
then you shouldn't condemn the Just and Mighty One
who is neither partial towards princes
nor favors the rich over the poor

>The words of the wise spoken in quiet are more acceptable than the cry of a ruler among fools    

>Wise words bring approval, but fools are destroyed by their own words

>So we must listen very carefully  to the truth that we have heard, or we may drift away from it.

>How does the man you love differ from any other,
you most beautiful of women?
How does the man you love differ from any other,
that you should give us this charge?

>Who put wisdom in people's inner parts?
Who gave understanding to the mind?
Who, by wisdom, can number the clouds?
Who can tilt the water-skins of heaven,
so that the dust becomes a mass,
and its clods stick together?

>If a man dies, will he live again? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come.

>Human life is like forced army service, like a life of hard manual labor

>We blossom like a flower and then wither. Like a passing shadow, we quickly disappear.

>Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than  themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding.

>Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness

>Are you going to keep to the old way, the one the wicked have trodden

>Can his armies be numbered? On whom does his light not shine?

>If he took you to court, could you fool him, just as you fool others?

>Buy the truth, don't sell it, also wisdom, discipline, and discernment.

>Look, before God I'm the same as you; I too am fashioned from clay.
