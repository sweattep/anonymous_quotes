>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, 
who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age - and then have fallen away -
to be restored to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to open shame.
